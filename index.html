                    <p>Cyber-Physical-Human systems comprises mainly of three fundamental entities, namely</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Cyber:</b> Infrastructure that provides/supports communication, storage and other information technology (IT) services.</li>
                        <li><b>Physical:</b> Physical devices such as sensors and actuators.</li>
                        <li><b>Human:</b> People (residents, workers and/or users) within the system.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most of the current services are designed based on only two of the above three entities. For instance, social networks, recommender systems and crowdsourcing are examples of cyber-human systems where human agents interact with cyber infrastructure. On
                        the other hand, disaster management and human-machine interfaces such as flight-cockpits are examples for physical-human systems. At the same time, Internet-of-Things (IoT), smart grids and industrial control systems are some of
                        the practical examples of cyber-physical systems. However, smart living applications rely on the framework of cyber-physical-human systems since it provides a common platform to support interaction between technology (cyber-physical
                        infrastructure) and people. </p>
