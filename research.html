                    <p>
                        The main goal of CPHS lab is to develop strategic and trustworthy cyber-physical-human systems which improve safety, reliability, trust and security in human-machine interaction. 
                        In this regard, the research team makes scientific and technological advancements in the areas of machine learning, human behavior prediction/modeling, game theory and multi-agent control. 
                        The work carried out in this lab is supported by diverse funding agencies such as National Science Foundation, The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (CDC-NIOSH) and Boeing.

                    <h2>Facilities</h2>
                    <p>
                        Cyber-Physical-Human Systems Laboratory (in short, CPHS lab) is directed by Dr. Sid Nadendla and is housed in Room 101 (Total area: 626 sq. ft) in the Computer Science department at Missouri University of Science and Technology (in short, Missouri S&T). 
                        The lab has six high-performance Dell-Precision workstations which are equipped with a wide range of hardware and software capabilities, including MATLAB, Python, MATSIM, TensorFlow and PyTorch.
                        One of these workstations also is equipped with Brainchip's Akida ADK1000 neuromorphic chipset.
                        The lab also has 10 Waveshare JetBot AI kits and 10 additional Nvidiaâ€™s 2GB Jetson Nano developer kits, which are used to develop f-1/18th vehicles that can mimic both manual and self-driving cars, as well as road side units in our transportation testbed.
