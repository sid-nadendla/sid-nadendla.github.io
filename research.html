                                    Bias evaluation in machine-learning based services (MLS) based on traditional algorithmic fairness notions that rely on comparative principles is practically difficult, making it necessary to rely on human auditor feedback. However, in spite of taking
                                    rigorous training on various comparative fairness notions, human auditors are known to disagree on various aspects of fairness notions in practice, making it difficult to collect reliable feedback.With the advancements
                                    of algorithmic decision making, biases and unfair treatment have also increased which affects human lives significantly. Many fair notions have been introduced in the past few years in order to eliminate the biases.
                                    But, these notions of fairness do not satisfy individual preferences and does not meet the expectations of society. We introduce a new notion of fairness called subjective fairness where a trusted auditor evaluates
                                    the efficiency of a classifier by employing an arbitrary fairness rule. We also design a post-processing approach to improve subjective fairness using a randomization scheme over the outputs and prove that, the probability
                                    of improving fairness is independent of the randomization scheme. Our work offers a paradigm shift to the domain of algorithmic fairness via proposing a new fairness notion based on the principle of non-comparative
                                    justice. In contrary to traditional fairness notions where the outcomes of two individuals/groups are compared, our proposed notion compares the MLS' outcome with a desired outcome for each input. This desired outcome
                                    naturally describes a human auditor's expectation, and can be easily used to evaluate MLS on crowd-auditing platforms.

                                    The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, is an infectious disease which was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan and has spread world wide significantly making it a pandemic. In order to understand and stop the spread of COVID-19, various countries have
                                    introduced different ways of testing. We developed a cost-efficient and high-accuracy testing tool for COVID-19 by analyzing the patient's Chest X-rays and CT-scans. We designed a dashboard to upload the X-ray and CT-scan
                                    images inorder to get the test results. Along with the X-ray images, the tool also displays the PSI and CURB-65 scores. The PSI (Pneumonia Severity Index) score calculates the probability of mortality of patients and
                                    is often used to predict the need for hospitalization in people with pneumonia. The CURB-65 is also a similar score but it is easy to compute.

                                    Blockchain systems often employ proof-of-work consensus protocols to validate and add transactions into hashchains.
                                    These protocols involve competition among miners in solving
                                    cryptopuzzles (e.g. SHA-256 hash computation in Bitcoin) in
                                    exchange for a monetary reward. Here, we model mining as
                                    an all-pay auction, where minersâ€™ computational efforts are
                                    interpreted as bids, and the allocation function is the probability
                                    of solving the cryptopuzzle in a single attempt with unit (normalized) computational capability. Such an allocation function
                                    captures how blockchain systems control the difficulty o f the
                                    cryptopuzzle as a function of minersâ€™ computational abilities
                                    (bids). In an attempt to reduce mining costs, we investigate
                                    designing a mining auction mechanism which induces a logit
                                    equilibrium amongst the miners with choice distributions that
                                    are unilaterally decreasing with costs at each miner. We show it
                                    is impossible to design a lenient allocation function that does this.
                                    Specifically, we show that there exists no allocation function that
                                    discourages miners to bid higher costs at logit equilibrium, if the
                                    rate of change of difficulty w ith r espect t o e ach m inerâ€™s c ost is
                                    bounded by the inverse of the sum of costs of all the miners.
                                    Additionally, we also show that it is necessary to have allocation
                                    functions that decrease with increasing number of players. As a
                                    result, it is difficult t o a chieve d ecentralization a nd accomplish
                                    secure blockchain systems with global block difficulty which relies
                                    only on total hash rate.
