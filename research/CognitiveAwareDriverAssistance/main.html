                        Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are receiving increased attention because they mimic synaptic connections in biological systems and produce spike trains, which can be approximated by binary values for computational efficiency. 
                        Recently, the addition of convolutional layers to combine the feature extraction power of convolutional networks with the computational efficiency of SNNs has been introduced. 
                        This paper studies the feasibility of using a convolutional spiking neural network (CSNN) to detect anticipatory slow cortical potentials (SCPs) related to braking intention in human participants using an electroencephalogram (EEG). 
                        Data was collected during an experiment wherein participants operated a remote-controlled vehicle on a testbed designed to simulate an urban environment. 
                        Participants were alerted to an incoming braking event via an audio countdown to elicit anticipatory potentials that were measured using an EEG. 
                        The CSNNâ€™s performance was compared to a standard CNN, EEGNet and three graph neural networks via 10-fold cross-validation. 
                        The CSNN outperformed all the other neural networks, and had a predictive accuracy of 99.06\% with a true positive rate of 98.50\%, a true negative rate of 99.20\% and an F1-score of 0.98. 
                        Performance of the CSNN was comparable to the CNN in an ablation study using a subset of EEG channels that localized SCPs. 
                        Classification performance of the CSNN degraded only slightly when the floating-point EEG data were converted into spike trains via delta modulation to mimic synaptic connections.

                        State-of-the-art driver-assist systems have failed to effectively mitigate driver inattention and had minimal impacts on the ever-growing number of road mishaps (e.g. life loss, physical injuries due to accidents caused by various factors that lead to driver inattention).  
                        This is because state-of-the-art human-machine interaction models still lack psychological insights to the characterization of the attention level of the driver. 
                        Therefore, in an attempt to improve the persuasive effectiveness of driver-assist systems, we develop a novel strategic and personalized driver-assist system which adapts to the driver's mental state and choice behavior. 
                        First, we propose a novel equilibrium notion in human-system interaction games, where the system maximizes its expected utility and human decisions can be characterized using any general decision model. 
                        Then we use this novel equilibrium notion to investigate the strategic driver-vehicle interaction game where the car presents a persuasive recommendation to steer the driver towards safer driving decisions. 
                        We assume that the driver employs an open-quantum system cognition model, which captures complex aspects of human decision making such as violations to classical law of total probability and incompatibility of certain mental representations of information. 
                        We present closed-form expressions for players' final responses to each other's strategies so that we can numerically compute both pure and mixed equilibria. 
                        Numerical results are presented to illustrate both kinds of equilibria.
